### 4. Usage

In the AMS-DOS repository, each module is organized into its dedicated folder. This structure makes the codebase easy to navigate, modular, and scalable. Each folder contains the main `.ino` file along with any necessary `.h` (header) and `.cpp` (source) files for that module’s functionality.

Here’s how each module is structured:

1. **Folder Structure**: Each module resides in a folder named after its respective 8-character identifier (e.g., `taskmgmt`, `memmgmt`, etc.).

2. **Module Contents**:
   - **`.ino` File**: Contains the main code for the module. This file typically serves as the entry point for the module’s functionality and interacts with the primary AMS-DOS system.
   - **`.h` File**: The header file declares functions, constants, and any necessary global variables, making them accessible to other modules or the core AMS-DOS system.
   - **`.cpp` File**: Contains the function implementations and logic for the module. This file handles the core processing, interactions with peripherals, data management, or other relevant tasks specific to the module.

3. **Example Directory Structure**:

   ```
   /ams-dos
   ├── /taskmgmt
   │   ├── taskmgmt.ino
   │   ├── taskmgmt.h
   │   └── taskmgmt.cpp
   ├── /memmgmt
   │   ├── memmgmt.ino
   │   ├── memmgmt.h
   │   └── memmgmt.cpp
   ├── /filesys
   │   ├── filesys.ino
   │   ├── filesys.h
   │   └── filesys.cpp
   ├── /periphmg
   │   ├── periphmg.ino
   │   ├── periphmg.h
   │   └── periphmg.cpp
   ├── /serialio
   │   ├── serialio.ino
   │   ├── serialio.h
   │   └── serialio.cpp
   └── ... (and so on for each module)
   ```

4. **Modular Interaction**:
   - Each module folder is self-contained, making it easy to update, test, and manage independently.
   - Other modules or core files in AMS-DOS can include a module’s `.h` file to access its functions and integrate its functionality, supporting seamless cross-module communication.

This repository structure ensures each module is clearly separated and manageable, making AMS-DOS a well-organized and maintainable operating system for Arduino.
