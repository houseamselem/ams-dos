# AMS-DOS

**Arduino Modular System & Dedicated Operating Suite**

AMS-DOS is a lightweight, efficient operating system designed specifically for Arduino microcontrollers. Built to maximize the potential of limited resources, AMS-DOS provides a structured environment for managing tasks, memory, and peripherals. This OS enables Arduino enthusiasts and developers to organize and execute complex programs on simple hardware, bringing multi-tasking and a more structured development approach to the Arduino platform.

### 1. Key Features

1. **Basic Task Scheduler**  
   - Supports cooperative multitasking, allowing multiple tasks to run in sequence without interruption.
   - Provides delay and timing functions to schedule task execution.

2. **Memory Management**  
   - Allocates and deallocates memory dynamically to optimize limited SRAM usage.
   - Includes memory monitoring tools to help developers track and manage memory use efficiently.

3. **File System Support**  
   - Supports basic file management on connected SD cards, allowing file creation, reading, writing, and deletion.
   - Enables the storage and retrieval of data for persistent applications.

4. **Peripheral Management**  
   - Provides built-in drivers for common peripherals (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO management).
   - Simplifies interfacing with connected devices like sensors, displays, and communication modules.

5. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
   - Offers a simple CLI that can be accessed over serial communication for debugging and direct control of the Arduino.
   - Commands include system info, memory status, task listing, and file management.

6. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Integration**  
   - Supports integration with RTC modules for time-based tasks and data logging.
   - Allows scheduling of tasks based on real-world time.

7. **Inter-Task Communication**  
   - Provides basic message-passing functionality for tasks to communicate and synchronize with each other.

8. **Debugging Tools**  
   - Includes debugging functions like logging, error tracking, and system diagnostics over serial output.
   - Helps developers monitor task execution, performance, and system status.

9. **Power Management**  
   - Optimizes power usage by enabling sleep modes and power-saving features, extending battery life for mobile applications.
   - Manages CPU cycles to reduce power usage during low-demand periods.

10. **Basic Networking Support**  
    - Compatible with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules (such as ESP8266, ESP32) for basic networking tasks.
    - Enables sending and receiving data over networks for IoT applications.

### 2. Benefits

AMS-DOS is built for developers who want more control and efficiency in their Arduino projects.
By providing the essential features of an operating system, AMS-DOS allows for more structured and scalable programs, making Arduino applications more robust, reliable, and ready for real-world deployment.
Whether it’s a complex robotics system or a simple sensor logger, AMS-DOS brings a new level of organization and capability to Arduino projects.

### 4. Usage

In the AMS-DOS repository, each module is organized into its dedicated folder. This structure makes the codebase easy to navigate, modular, and scalable. Each folder contains the main `.ino` file along with any necessary `.h` (header) and `.cpp` (source) files for that module’s functionality.

Here’s how each module is structured:

1. **Folder Structure**: Each module resides in a folder named after its respective 8-character identifier (e.g., `taskmgmt`, `memmgmt`, etc.).

2. **Module Contents**:
   - **`.ino` File**: Contains the main code for the module. This file typically serves as the entry point for the module’s functionality and interacts with the primary AMS-DOS system.
   - **`.h` File**: The header file declares functions, constants, and any necessary global variables, making them accessible to other modules or the core AMS-DOS system.
   - **`.cpp` File**: Contains the function implementations and logic for the module. This file handles the core processing, interactions with peripherals, data management, or other relevant tasks specific to the module.

3. **Example Directory Structure**:

   ```
   /ams-dos
   ├── /taskmgmt
   │   ├── taskmgmt.ino
   │   ├── taskmgmt.h
   │   └── taskmgmt.cpp
   ├── /memmgmt
   │   ├── memmgmt.ino
   │   ├── memmgmt.h
   │   └── memmgmt.cpp
   ├── /filesys
   │   ├── filesys.ino
   │   ├── filesys.h
   │   └── filesys.cpp
   ├── /periphmg
   │   ├── periphmg.ino
   │   ├── periphmg.h
   │   └── periphmg.cpp
   ├── /serialio
   │   ├── serialio.ino
   │   ├── serialio.h
   │   └── serialio.cpp
   └── ... (and so on for each module)
   ```

4. **Modular Interaction**:
   - Each module folder is self-contained, making it easy to update, test, and manage independently.
   - Other modules or core files in AMS-DOS can include a module’s `.h` file to access its functions and integrate its functionality, supporting seamless cross-module communication.

This repository structure ensures each module is clearly separated and manageable, making AMS-DOS a well-organized and maintainable operating system for Arduino.
